# PiPi package

## Description

Calculate inequalities across social classes if the target variable can coded as 
a dummy variable (0, 1). To define the level of inequality the Lorenz Curve is 
used, which shows the distribution of participants (e.g. voters) across the 
pre-defined social classes (e.g. level of education).
